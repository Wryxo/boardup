<p>For now beta version of my internet whiteboard application. Feel free to register, create boards to paint rectangles and ellipses.
    Also you can add friends, if you know their userid and give them permission to add, edit or delete objects from your board. 
    Anything here might be broken, please @Html.ActionLink("contact me", "Contact") if you find any bug.</p>
